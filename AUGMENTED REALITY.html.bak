<B>Augmented Reality is the blending of Virtual Reality and real life AR is using technology to superimpose information such as sounds, images and text on the real world that we can see images are created by developers within applications that blend in with content in the real world AR users can interact with virtual content in the real world and also distinguish between virtual and real content. AR is not a new technology it was used in the display panels of fighter aircraft in the 1990s. The pre displayed information about the altitude, direction and speed of the aircraft. A few years later the panels displayed the target objects
In 2009, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's developed SixthSense.<img src ="ar 1.jpg" height="200px" width ="400px" STYLE ="float:LEFT;"> It is a small device that is wore like a pendant and combines the use of a camera, small projector, smartphone and minor The projector and the camera are connected to the mobile device in the user's pocket. The projector projects the visual information on physical surfaces such as walls and other objects. The camera recognizes and tracks the user's hand gestures with the help of computer vision techniques
Google Glass created in 2013 is an <img src ="ar4.jpg" height="200px" width ="400px" STYLE ="float:RIGHT;">example of wearable  interface. It helps the user to remain focussed on the work displays on the user's glass screen through a small projec it responds to voice commands to activate an application an time.
AR enters the lives of most people through phones and tablets. <img src ="ar2.jpg" height="200px" width ="400px" STYLE ="float:LEFT;">Vito Technology's Star Walk app lets a user point their phone or tablet camera at the sky and see the names of stars and planets superimposed on the image. One more app called Layar uses the GPS location of the smartphone and the camera to collect information about the user's surroundings. The app then shows information about the nearby restaurants, stores and places of interest.
Disney Research developed a coloring book with AR. After the user colors in a character in the book, he/she launches the app on the device. The app uses the camera to detect the character that was colored. The app also uses AR to recreate the character in a 3D form on the screen.<br><br><br>
